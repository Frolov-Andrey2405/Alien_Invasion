# Alien_Invasion
The "Alien Invasion" project uses the Pygame package to develop a 2D game in which the goal is to shoot down a fleet of aliens that tumble down the screen in levels that increase in speed and difficulty. 

Each player controls a ship that is in the middle of the bottom 
edge of the screen. The player moves the ship left and right with 
the cursor keys; the space bar is used to shoot. At the beginning of 
the game the alien fleet is at the top of the screen and gradually 
goes down, also shifting sideways. The player destroys the aliens 
with shots. If he manages to shoot down all the aliens, a new fleet 
appears that moves faster than the previous one. If an alien collides 
with the player's ship or reaches the bottom edge of the screen, the 
player loses the ship. If the player loses all three ships, the game 
ends.
