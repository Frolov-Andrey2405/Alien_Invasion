# Alien_Invasion

The Alien Invasion 🛸 project uses the Pygame 🐍 package to develop a 2D game in which the goal is to shoot down a fleet of aliens that drop onto the screen in levels that increase in speed and difficulty. 

Each player controls a spaceship 🚀 that sits in the middle of the bottom edge of the screen. The player moves the ship left ⬅️ and right ➡️ with the cursor keys; the space bar is used to shoot. At the beginning of the game the alien fleet 👾 is at the top of the screen and gradually goes down, also shifting sideways. The player destroys the aliens with shots 💥

If he manages to destroy all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous one. If the alien collides with the player's ship or reaches the bottom edge of the screen, the player loses the ship . If the player loses all three ships, the game ends 🔚
